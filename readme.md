# Flux Capacitor

> The flux capacitor is a simple electron app, which creates backups for you.


## What is the Flux Capacitor?

The flux-capacitor is a kind of a time machine for Linux and Windows. Mac users already have a very powerful time machine on board.

When you are working inside a folder and you add that folder to the flux-capacitor all changes are watched. All versions of a file are stored inside a backup folder, named the dataflux folder. Inside that folder the file and folder structure are exactly like in the working folder. Just all the files have the last change date inside the filename. So no special file browser is needed to browse threw your backups.

## Why use the Flux Capacitor?

Because it is very easy to use and you don't need to care about when to backup. Cause of the additional backup folder you don't need to rename your file everytime you change something.

You should switch to Flux Capacitor, if your files inside a folder looks like:

* myThesis_01
* myThesis_01a
* myThesis_03
* ...
